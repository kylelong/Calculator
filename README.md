# Pre-work - Tipper

Tipper is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Kyle Long

Time spent:6 hours spent in total //changed on 1/5/16. Sorry, I realized this error too late.



The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [ x ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X ] Settings page 
* [ X ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I added a tip history feature, so someone will know the last amount their bill was and what date and time.
